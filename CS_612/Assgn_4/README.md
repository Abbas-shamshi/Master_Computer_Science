The react webapp comprises of 3 blogs posts written by me and is consuming News API which refreshes its API content every 5 secs.

I'm using local JSON for my articles, many components for react and functions.

In the project directory, you can run:

For setting up you would need npm
for installing all the node modules and dependencies

### `npm install`

for installing all the node modules and dependencies

 generate your news api from 'https://newsapi.org'
 paste your generated api key in nav.js file in apikey variable

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
